# Artifex Engineering OPM150
Artifex Optical Power Meter OPM150 is a low cost, versatile power monitor for use in the lab and for laser servicing as well as for OEM applications. It's designed for precise measurement of power, from nW to kW, for use in the lab and for OEM applications.

Different sensor heads are available covering 250-1000nm, 800-1550nm, 400-1600nm, 800-2000nm, 1000-2200nm and 1300-2490nm. Each head is automatically recognized and its individual calibration data are uploaded to the system.

This product can be equipped with a variety of adapters and accessories for your specific application.

## Setup

* Connect the OPM150 to a free USB port of your computer using the supplied USB cable.
* The drivers should install automatically via the Windows Update system. If errors occur, install the drivers manually or use the Artifex application software. The drivers are supplied with the OPM150 on a USB flash drive or can be downloaded from the website (www.artifex-engineering.com).
* Connect an OPM150 detector head to the OPM150 base unit.

## Usage

* In the "Unit" field, select the unit in which you want to display the measured values.
    - You can choose between:
        - A (Ampere) - The detector current
        - W (Watt) - The measured optical power
        - dBm - Power level in a logarithmic scale respective to one milliwatt.
        - W/cm2 - Optical power density of the beam. Selecting this option displays the "Aperture in mm" input field. The aperture diameter of the detector must be entered there to obtain the power density.
* If the selected unit is power density, enter the aperture diameter in the "Aperture in mm" field.
* Enter the wavelength of your laser or LED in nm in the field 'Wavelength in nm'.
* You can select a fixed gain in the field 'Gain' or use 'Auto' for automatic gain selection.
* In the "Filter factor" field, you can enter the attenuation factor of an optical filter. Since optical filters are wavelength dependent, the value must correspond to the entered wavelength.
* To measure at different wavelengths, please use the appropriate sensor head for the wavelength range.
