# SweepMe! driver
# * Module: Logger
# * Instrument: Template

### Each device class must have a name like: "<Module>-<Manufacturer>_<Model>".

### New drivers can also be created as a service.
### Please write to "contact@sweep-me.net" if you need a new driver of if you need support with creating one.

### import further python module here as usual, many packages come with SweepMe!,
### all other have to be shipped with the device class
import pathlib
import random

### If you like to see the source code of EmptyDevice, take a look at the pysweepme package that contains this file
from pysweepme.EmptyDeviceClass import EmptyDevice
from pysweepme.ErrorMessage import debug, error

### use the next two lines to add the folder of this device class to the PATH variable
# from FolderManager import addFolderToPATH
# addFolderToPATH()
### if you use 'addFolderToPATH', you can now import packages that are shipped with your device class
